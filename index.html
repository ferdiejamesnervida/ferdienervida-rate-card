  <div class="intro">
    <p>Ferdie James Nervida is one of the emerging voices in blockchain forensics and cybersecurity education in the Philippines. A TEDx speaker, public sector advocate, and digital threat researcher, he has traced illicit transactions, dissected smart contract exploits, and delivered over 100 talks and trainings across schools, government institutions, and tech events.</p>
